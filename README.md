# UFOs

# Overview
The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly webpage that could filter UFO sightings data using multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to date, filters were added for city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
Welcome to our UFO Sitings Home Page

When you first open the site, you will see the table populated with all siting information.

Simply enter your search criteria in lowercase type and hit enter.

In the image below, "ca" has been entered in the state box and "light" in the shape box. The search produced all sightings results that occured in the state of California where viewers reported the shape of their sighting as a "light."

To clear filters and begin a new search, delete type from filters and replace with new search criteria.

# Summary

One drawback to this site is that it relies upon a relatively small data set of sightings during two weeks in January of 2010. Additionally, the filter interface is case-sensitive and results must be viewed of one day at a time.
